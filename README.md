# EditorTrees
AVL trees whose nodes hold characters. Can be used as text editor.
Self-balancing tree supports insertion of elements one at a time or as a string at any specified position in the tree. Supports deletion of elements at specified locations. Also supports concatenation of multiple trees, search for strings within the tree, and printing of elements at specified locations, alerting user when indexes they enter are out of bounds.
